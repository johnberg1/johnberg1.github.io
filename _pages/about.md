Hello. My name is Ahmet Canberk Baykal. I am a MSc. student at Ko√ß University and a Graduate Researcher at [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/). 

My research at KUIS AI Lab is focused on Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am co-advised by [Prof. Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/) and [Prof. Deniz Yuret](http://www.denizyuret.com/). I am also working closely with [Prof. Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/) from Hacettepe University and [Duygu Ceylan](https://www.duygu-ceylan.com/) from Adobe Research.
