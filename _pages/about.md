Hello. My name is Ahmet Canberk Baykal. I am a PhD student in Computer Science and an AI Researcher at University of Cambridge. Previously, I was a Graduate Researcher at and M.Sc. student [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"}. I have obtained my B.Sc. degree from Bilkent University, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department and my M.S. degree from Koç University, Computer Science and Engineering.

I am part of the [Cambridge Open Reality and Visual AI Laboratory (CORE LAB)](https://core-lab.io){:target="_blank"}, under supervision of [Prof. Cengiz Öztireli](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aco41/){:target="_blank"}. My research is focused at 3D Computer Vision. Previously, at KUIS AI Center, I worked on Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, specifically Text-Guided Image Generation and Manipulation. I was co-advised by [Prof. Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Deniz Yuret](http://www.denizyuret.com/){:target="_blank"} and I also worked closely with [Prof. Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/){:target="_blank"} from Hacettepe University and [Dr. Duygu Ceylan](https://www.duygu-ceylan.com/){:target="_blank"} from Adobe Research.
